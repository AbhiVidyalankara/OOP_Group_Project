If you get "ClassNotFoundException":
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (src/ or ui/)
- Use the -d . flag when compiling console app
- Run with: java Medicare.MedicareApp (not just MedicareApp)

If compilation fails:
- Ensure Java JDK 8 or higher is installed
- Check that javac is in your PATH
- Try running run.bat as administrator
